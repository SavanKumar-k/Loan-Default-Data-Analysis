ðŸ”¹ Project Overview

This project analyzes loan default patterns using Dataflows to uncover borrower risk factors, repayment trends, and loan distribution. Power BI dashboards were built to visualize patterns across demographics, credit scores, employment, and income groups, enabling data-driven financial decisions.

ðŸ”¹ Tools & Technologies

SQL Server / Dataflows â€“ Data extraction & cleaning

Power BI â€“ Dashboard & visualization

Excel â€“ Preprocessing & validation

ðŸ”¹ Process

Data Cleaning & Transformation â€“ Removed nulls, duplicates, standardized values

Data Modeling â€“ Created relationships between customer, loan, and repayment datasets

Visualization â€“ Designed interactive dashboards with filters, drilldowns, and KPIs

Insights â€“ Identified repayment patterns, default risks, and loan distributions

ðŸ”¹ Project Insights

Employment type and income strongly influence default risk.

Younger borrowers tend to take smaller loans, while middle-aged groups take larger ones.

Borrowers with low credit scores have a much higher default rate.

Loan purpose and education level correlate with repayment behaviors.

Year-over-year trends highlight rising defaults in specific periods.

Borrowers with mortgages and dependents tend to take higher loans.

ðŸ”¹ Conclusion

This project highlights how Power BI dashboards can bring actionable insights to financial institutions by analyzing loan behavior across multiple demographic and financial dimensions. Such insights help in better risk assessment, loan approval strategy, and policy decisions.
